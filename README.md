# Feature list

- Server- and client-side validation with your favorite validation libraries, and more to come: ðŸ’¥ [Arktype](https://arktype.io/) ðŸ’¥ [class-validator](https://github.com/typestack/class-validator) ðŸ’¥ [Effect](https://effect.website/) ðŸ’¥ [Joi](https://joi.dev/) ðŸ’¥ [Superstruct](https://docs.superstructjs.org/) ðŸ’¥ [TypeBox](https://github.com/sinclairzx81/typebox) ðŸ’¥ [Valibot](https://valibot.dev/) ðŸ’¥ [VineJS](https://vinejs.dev/) ðŸ’¥ [Yup](https://github.com/jquense/yup) ðŸ’¥ [Zod](https://zod.dev/) ðŸ’¥ or use [JSON Schema](https://json-schema.org/) directly.
- Seamless merging of `PageData` and `ActionData` - Forget about how to combine them, just focus on your form data, always strongly typed.
- [Auto-centering and focusing](https://superforms.rocks/concepts/error-handling#usage-client) on invalid form fields.
- [Tainted form detection](https://superforms.rocks/concepts/tainted), prevents the user from losing data if navigating away from an unsaved form. Or use [snapshots](https://superforms.rocks/concepts/snapshots) to save the form state.
- Automatically coerces `FormData` into correct types, including arrays and files.
- For advanced data structures, forget about the limitations of `FormData` - Post [nested data structures](https://superforms.rocks/concepts/nested-data) like a RPC call.
- Generates [default form values](https://superforms.rocks/default-values) from many validation schemas.
- Handles [multiple forms](https://superforms.rocks/concepts/multiple-forms) on the same page.
- Works both on the server and with [single-page applications](https://superforms.rocks/concepts/spa) (SPA)!
- Convenient handling and validation of [file uploads](https://superforms.rocks/concepts/files), both on server and client and even in nested data.
- [Proxy objects](https://superforms.rocks/concepts/proxy-objects) for handling data conversions to string and back again.
- Realtime [client-side validation](https://superforms.rocks/concepts/client-validation) for the best possible UX.
- Create loading spinners easily with three [auto-updating timers](https://superforms.rocks/concepts/timers), based on human perception research.
- Hook into [a number of events](https://superforms.rocks/concepts/events) for full control over the validation data and the `ActionResult`, with a possibility to cancel the update at every step.
- Complete customization with a [huge list of options](https://superforms.rocks/api#superformform-options).
- No JavaScript required as default, but full support for [progressive enhancement](https://superforms.rocks/concepts/enhance).
- Comes with a Super Debugging Svelte Component: [SuperDebug](https://superforms.rocks/super-debug).
